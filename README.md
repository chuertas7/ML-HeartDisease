# Predicting and Classifying Heart Disease Subtypes Using Machine Learning: Early Detection of SCA, MI, Heart Failure, and CAD


## Overview
This repository contains a detailed project on predicting and classifying heart disease subtypes using machine learning. The project explores various supervised and unsupervised models, evaluates their performance, and provides insights into the prediction of heart disease events. The focus is on applying machine learning algorithms effectively to classify heart disease conditions, leveraging clinical data.

### Final Report:
- Comprehensive documentation of the project's methodology, results, and conclusions.
- Includes model performance evaluation and future work.

### Model Implementations:
Three implemented models available as Jupyter notebooks:
1. **KMeans Clustering**: An unsupervised learning approach for exploratory data analysis.
2. **Logistic Regression**: A supervised classification model with emphasis on interpretability.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A robust supervised classification method for handling complex data.
